## Academics

### Current Modules
- Statistical Modelling
- Interface Programming
- Research & Development Project

### Extra-cirricular
Alongside my projects, I regularly tackle Leetcode challenges to maintain & improve my coding proficiency across my strongest programming languages. You can find my profile [here](https://leetcode.com/u/Mattytomo365/), and my code in `LeetCode Solutions`.

Gaining industry experience is also really important to me, I have completed a placement with HARTS (Hospital Arts, Liverpool) as a Junior Business Systems Developer. I developed a database management desktop application during this time to reduce the administrative workload for members of staff.

## Projects

### Developing

**Experimental evaluation of forecasting approaches to restaurant sales**: Implementation and comparative evaluation of forecasting restaurant sales using Prophet, XGBoost, and Lasso. Models trained on cleaned & preprocessed data, fine-tuned and cross-validated, with appropriate performance metrics reported and compared; feature importance determined using ablation tests and permutation importance. Top model will be utilised for a full-stack forecasting platform.

**Bartering Platform**: A full-stack .NET 8 microservices and Angular frontend application with a strong focus on modularity and loose coupling. The application serves as a platform for exchanging goods/products between users based on selected filters, showcasing architectural patterns such as CQRS and Clean Architecture, RabbitMQ messaging. Please refer to my `Bartering-Platform` repository for further details.

**ML Restaurant Forecasting System** (Currenly on hold): A capstone web application, .NET backend and Angular frontend, following Clean Architecture whilst leveraging machine learning (approach established from comparative forecasting experiments in another project)to accurately forecast restaurant sales. The goal is to improve staffing and inventory decisions, I'm also working towards a pilot with a local restaurant. Please refer to my `ML-Restaurant-Forecasting-System` repository for further details.

### Deployed
**Student Planner**: Python & Tkinter project centred around turning a student's day into a focused checklist, syncing tasks & assignments with the user's Google Calendar. Tasks can be added, modified, deleted, categorised (module specific or general) and checked off through a simple, navigable interface featuring a prominent day-to-day checklist. Please refer to my `Student-Planner` repository for further details.

**Database Management System**: Built during my Junior Business Systems Developer role at Hospital Arts (HARTS), Liverpool: Python & Tkinter desktop application centralising admin data, reducing the manual workload for members of staff. Please refer to my `Database-Management-System` repository for further details.
