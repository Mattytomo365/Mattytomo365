## About me
Second year computer science student at Edge Hill University, with strong ambitions for a career in computer science. I'm currently in the stage of exploring different areas and roles in this vast industry, finding where i fit best.

I'm paritcularly interested in software development, cybersecurity, and AI, but i'm open to learning even more.

### Skills and Experience
I have experience in Python, C#, and Java. I also have exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Outside of computer science-related skills, I have strong communication, teamwork, leadership, and time management skills. I have a part-time job as a commis waiter in Gaucho, Liverpool, where I put these skills into practice.

Extra-curricular activities like a project placement/work experience placements, and previously being a commitee member of my university's Coding Club allow me to develop these skills.

### Hobbies and Interests
When I'm not coding, I love to run, read, and create digital art. Photography, learning new things, and technology also really interest me.

## What I'm Currently Learning
### Current Modules
* Introduction to Security
* Data Analytics
* Professional Practice

### Current Projects and Learning Goals
I'm not currently working on any new personal projects. Instead, I'm building and refining my professional portfolio, I'm currently at the stage of documenting my previous projects.

I have recently completed a data analysis project, where I applied knowledge gained in a recent module to perform sentiment analysis and collocation extraction using multiple approaches. I recognise there is still room for the addition of features in the future though.

I'm currently working on a Student Planner application which makes changes to a user's Google Calender through leveraging the Google Calendar API, allowing me to apply my knowledge of APIs and their usage in different contexts. Please refer to my `Student-Planner` repository for further details.

Gaining industry experience is also really important to me, I am currently completing a placement with HARTS (Hospital Arts, Liverpool) as a Junior Business Systems Developer. As part of this placement I am developing a database management application to reduce the administrative workload for members of staff, please refer to my `Volunteer-Management-System` for more details.
