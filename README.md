## About me
Second year computer science student at Edge Hill University, with strong ambitions for a career in computer science. I'm currently in the stage of exploring different areas and roles in this vast industry, finding where i fit best.

I'm paritcularly interested in software development, cybersecurity, and AI, but i'm open to learning even more.

### Skills and Experience
I have experience in Python, C#, and Java. I also have exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Outside of computer science-related skills, I have strong communication, teamwork, leadership, and time management skills. I have a part-time job as a commis waiter in Gaucho, Liverpool, where I put these skills into practice.

Extra-curricular activities like a project placement/work experience placements, and previously being a commitee member of my university's Coding Club allow me to develop these skills.

### Hobbies and Interests
When I'm not coding, I love to run, read, and create digital art. Photography, learning new things, and technology also really interest me.

## What I'm Currently Learning
### Current Modules
This will be updated once I start my third year.

### Current Projects and Learning Goals

I am currently planning a full stack .NET Core web application project which leverages an integrated machine learning model to predict the sales a local restaurant will generate on a specified day, taking a multitude of factors into account in order to achive the best accuracy. This application is also in discussion for potential real-world deployment.

I'm currently working on a Student Planner application which makes changes to a user's Google Calender through leveraging the Google Calendar API, allowing me to apply my knowledge of APIs and their usage in different contexts. Please refer to my `Student-Planner` repository for further details.

Gaining industry experience is also really important to me, I am currently completing a placement with HARTS (Hospital Arts, Liverpool) as a Junior Business Systems Developer. As part of this placement I am developing a database management application to reduce the administrative workload for members of staff, please refer to my `Database-Management-System` for more details.
