## About me
Second year computer science student at Edge Hill University, with strong ambitions for a career in computer science. I'm currently in the stage of exploring different areas and roles in this vast industry, finding where i fit best.

I'm paritcularly interested in software development & machine learning, however, I am open to expanding my interests even further.

### Skills and Experience
I have experience in Python, C#, and Java. I also have exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Previous experience in the hospitality industry has allowed me to form more interpersonal & social skills like communication, teamwork, leadership, and time management.

Extra-curricular activities like projects, placements/work experience, and societies at university allow me to develop these skills.

### Hobbies and Interests
When I'm not coding, I love to run, read, create digital art, and relax, which is most important for me to maintain a strong work-life balance. Learning new things also allows me to use spare time to my advantage.

## What I'm Currently Learning
### Current Modules
This will be updated once I start my third year.

### Current Projects and Learning Goals

I am currently planning a full stack React & .NET web application project which leverages an integrated machine learning model to predict the sales of a given week in the hospitality industry, restaurants specifically. A multitude of factors will be taken into account in order to achive the best accuracy. This application is also in discussion for potential real-world deployment into a local restaurant in exchange for utilisng their data. The application will take two forms once developed, a version specific to the project's stakeholders, based around their data. Then a more generic version which will utilise mock data, this will be handed into my university.

I'm currently in the deployment stage of a Student Planner application which makes changes to a user's Google Calender through leveraging the Google Calendar API, allowing me to apply my knowledge of APIs and their usage in different contexts. This application is currently being verified with Google. Please refer to my `Student-Planner` repository for further details.

Gaining industry experience is also really important to me, I am currently completing a placement with HARTS (Hospital Arts, Liverpool) as a Junior Business Systems Developer. As part of this placement I am developing a database management application to reduce the administrative workload for members of staff, please refer to my `Database-Management-System` for more details.
