### Extra-cirricular
Alongside my projects, I regularly tackle Leetcode challenges to maintain & improve my coding proficiency across my strongest programming languages. You can find my profile [here](https://leetcode.com/u/Mattytomo365/), and my code in `LeetCode Solutions`.

Gaining industry experience is also really important to me, I have recently completed a placement with HARTS (Hospital Arts, Liverpool) as a Junior Business Systems Developer. I developed a database management desktop application during this time to reduce the administrative workload for members of staff.
