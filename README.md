## About me
Second year computer science student at Edge Hill University, with strong ambitions for a career in computer science.
I'm currently in the stage of exploring different areas and roles in this vast industry, finding where i fit best.

I'm paritcularly interested in software development, cybersecurity, and AI, but i'm open to learning even more.

### Skills and Experience
I have experience in Python, C#, and Java.
I also have exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Hobbies and Interests
When I'm not coding, I love to run, read, and create digital art. Photography, learning new things, and technology also really interest me.

## What I'm Currently Learning
### Current Modules
* Introduction to Security
* Data Analytics
* Professional Practice

### Current Projects and Learning Goals
As of now, I'm not working on any new projects, instead, I'm taking the time to learn new things through online courses. 
I aim to gain a good level of understanding on all the different main sectors of computer science. Right now, I'm interested in learning about systems development.

Gaining industry experience is also really important to me, so I will be completing multiple placements (virtual and in-person) throughout this year.
