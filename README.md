### Extra-cirricular
Alongside my projects, I regularly tackle Leetcode challenges to maintain & improve my coding proficiency across my strongest programming languages. You can find my profile [here](https://leetcode.com/u/Mattytomo365/), and my code in `LeetCode Solutions`.

Gaining industry experience is also really important to me, I have recently completed a placement with HARTS (Hospital Arts, Liverpool) as a Junior Business Systems Developer. I developed a database management desktop application during this time to reduce the administrative workload for members of staff.

## Projects

### Developing
**ML Restaurant Forecasting System:** I am currently planning a full stack React & .NET web application project which leverages an integrated machine learning model to predict the sales of a given week in the hospitality industry, restaurants specifically. A multitude of factors will be taken into account in order to achive the best accuracy. This application is also in discussion for potential real-world deployment into a local restaurant in exchange for utilisng their data. Please refer to my `ML-Restaurant-Forecasting-System` repository for further details.

### Deployed
**Student Planner:** Python & Tkinter project centred around turning a student's day into a focused checklist, syncing tasks & assignments with the user's Google Calendar with the Google Calendar API. Tasks can be added, modified, deleted, categorised (module specific or general) and checked off through a simple, navigable interface featuring a prominent day-to-day checklist. Please refer to my `Student-Planner` repository for further details.

**Database Management System:** Built during my Junior Business Systems Developer role at Hospital Arts (HARTS), Liverpool: Python & Tkinter desktop application centralising admin data, reducing the manual workload for members of staff. Please refer to my `Database-Management-System` repository for further details.
