## About me
Second year computer science student at Edge Hill University, with strong ambitions for a career in computer science. I'm currently in the stage of exploring different areas and roles in this vast industry, finding where i fit best.

I'm paritcularly interested in software development, cybersecurity, and AI, but i'm open to learning even more.

### Skills and Experience
I have experience in Python, C#, and Java. I also have exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Outside of computer science-related skills, I have strong communication, teamwork, leadership, and time management skills. I have a part-time job as a commis waiter in Gaucho, Liverpool, where I put these skills into practice.

Extra-curricular activities like a project placement/work experience placements, and previously being a commitee member of my university's Coding Club allow me to develop these skills.

### Hobbies and Interests
When I'm not coding, I love to run, read, and create digital art. Photography, learning new things, and technology also really interest me.

## What I'm Currently Learning
### Current Modules
* Introduction to Security
* Data Analytics
* Professional Practice

### Current Projects and Learning Goals
I'm not currently working on any new personal projects. Instead, I'm building and refining my professional portfolio, I'm currently at the stage of documenting my previous projects.

I have recently finishing developing and documenting a prototpye for a simple educational game as part of my Professional Practice module, this is a group project. It was built in the PyCharm IDE, with the use of the PyGame library.

I'm taking the time to learn new things through online courses. I aim to gain a good level of understanding on all the different main sectors of computer science. Right now, I'm interested in learning about systems/software development, cybersecurity, and AI.

I am actively brainstorming ideas for small and large personal projects to develop over the course of the next few months.

Gaining industry experience is also really important to me, so I will be completing multiple placements (virtual and in-person) throughout this year.
